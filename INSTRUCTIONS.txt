                             PURPOSE OF THIS PACKAGE                            

The FORTRAN programs and shell scripts included in this package allow to compute
bolometric corrections in a number of filters (up to 5) for input values of
Teff, log(g), [Fe/H], E(B-V) and [alpha/Fe]. Bolometric corrections are
computed as described in Casagrande & VandenBerg (2014, Paper I), Casagrande &
VandenBerg (2018a, Paper II) and Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018b, for the Gaia
system), using MARCS synthetic stellar fluxes (Gustafsson et al. 2008).
The grid covers the range Teff=[2600,8000], log(g)=[-0.5,5.5] and
[Fe/H]=[-4.0,+1.0] for standard alpha-enhancement (although the coverage is not
uniform across the grid, and the range of [Fe/H] varies somewhat for different
values of alpha-enhancement). Note that bolometric corrections can be combined
to derive colour combinations (see description in next Section). 

Please refer to Appendix A of Paper II for an in-depth description of the
parameter space covered, and FORTRAN programs included in this package. 
Here we give a very brief explanation of each file, along with a few practical
examples to bring users up to speed in learning how to run the codes provided.
Commands are intended for UNIX-like based systems (UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X). The
shell scripts provided (bcgo, bcall, cmdgo) use a number of standard terminal
commands, and assume that a gfortran compiler is installed. Mac OS X gfortran
compiler is freely available from http://hpc.sourceforge.net
Please see comments in the shell scrips for further info, and compiler options.
Feel free to modify the shell scripts to use your preferred FORTRAN compiler,
or to best fit your needs.
Now, to jump-start go to EXAMPLES below (in most cases, example B is what you
will be dealing with). Otherwise, keep reading. 

                              BOLOMETRIC CORRECTIONS
			      
The bolometric correction (BC) in a given filter (say, "i") is defined as:
BC_i = M_bol - M_i
where M_bol is the bolometric magnitude, and M_i is the magnitude in "i" filter.
It follows that the colour index between two filters ("i" and "j") is:
i-j = BC_j - BC_i
(note the reversal in the subscripts!). If the bolometric flux (i.e. the flux
as measured on the Earth in units of erg s-1 cm-2) from a star of known apparent
magnitude wants to be derived from a bolometric correction, please use 
Eq (3) in Paper II. Our tables of bolometric corrections adopt
M_(bol,Sun) = 4.75. This is a an arbitrary zero-point, and any value is
equally legitimate on the condition that once chosen, all bolometric
corrections are scaled accordingly. At the cost of being pedantic, please
beware that if you use our bolometric correction tables with a set of M_bol
from another source, where a different M_(bol,Sun) is adopted, then a zero-point
correction is necessary (see discussion in Section 3 of Paper II).

Our programs return bolometric corrections for a given set of log(g), [Fe/H] and
Teff. Hence, errors associated to bolometric corrections can easily be
estimated running a MonteCarlo with realistic uncertainties on input stellar
parameters. Errors associated to a bolometric flux can then be derived
propagating in Eq (3, Paper II) errors in BC (from MonteCarlo) and observed
magnitude (note that the uncertainty in adopted Lsun should also be included,
if the uncertainty in the zero point of the bolometric flux scale wants to be
taken into account).
Note that the above sources of uncertainty do not address how realistic the
MARCS synthetic stellar fluxes (from which BCs are derived) are. Extensive
comparison of our synthetic photometry with observations indicates that MARCS
fluxes perform overall well across optical and infrared bands (but please,
refer to Sections 4 in Paper I and II for a thorough discussion of successes
and limitations). For F and G dwarfs, absolute spectrophotometry from the
CALSPEC library shows that bolometric fluxes can be recovered to about 2
percent from bolometric corrections in a single band. Uncertainties are halved
when combining bolometric corrections in more bands. Importantly, for F and G
dwarfs the CALSPEC comparison indicates that errors estimated from a MonteCarlo
as described above account for the dominant source of uncertainty. 

Bolometric corrections can be computed in several photometric systems. For a
description of each of those, please refer to our papers (Sec 2.9-2.11 in
Paper I, and Sec 2.1-2.4 in Paper II, and Sec 2 in Casagrande & VandenBerg
2018b). Some notable caveats:

- In selectbc.data, it is possible to select Gaia synthetic photometry in the 
  (_vega) or AB (_ab) system, although magnitudes published in Data Release 2
  are on the Vega system only. Also, it is possible to select different
  flavours of Gaia filters and zero-points as explained further below (although
  the effects are rather small, unless going to extreme colours). 
  Synthetic photometry is available with transmission curves and zero-points
  used for the Gaia data processing (Gaia_pro), and with revised transmission
  curves and zero-points (Gaia_rev). Further details on transmission curves and
  zero-points are given in Evan et al. (2018). A third set has also been
  computed, using revised transmission curves together with the zero-points
  used for the data processing, and it should better represent the actual Gaia
  data (Gaia_DR2).
  We advise using the Gaia_DR2 set, although differences among the three are
  typically few mmag only, and users are welcome to explore the effect of
  choosing different sets.

  ***************
  ** IMPORTANT **
  ***************
  Please note that the magnitude dependent offset in Gaia G band found by
  Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018b) is not corrected for by our routines. In fact,
  this correction applies to Gaia magnitudes, and not to our BCs. If users wish
  to correct observed Gaia G photometry, they should do so by applying Eq (3)
  from Casagrande & VandenBerg (2018b).

- Tycho photometry quickly downgrades for Vtycho > 9, and Hipparcos
  Hp photometry of the brightest stars is likely affected by pulse pileup:
  beware when using bolometric corrections for stars in these Tycho/Hipparcos
  regimes!
  
- SkyMapper synthetic photometry is computed assuming perfect standardisation to
  the AB system: the standardisation of observations is still work in progress.
  As a result, zero-point shifts might be necessary to replicate observations.
  
- JWST synthetic photometry is computed with certain assumptions on zero-points:
  the standardisation of real data should be checked to determine whether any
  zero-point shifts should be applied to our definitions. JWST synthetic
  photometry is computed using the throughputs described in Paper II (Sec 2.4.1
  and 2.4.2), but modification of optical telescope elements might occur
  during the deployment of JWST in space. Note that synthetic photometry
  in the AB system can be readily transformed into Jansky (Eq 4, Paper II).


       	              REDDENING AND EXTINCTION COEFFICIENTS
  
Since our BCs can be computed for different values of reddening (assuming the
Cardelli et al. 1989 extinction law), our routines by-pass the need for
extinction coefficients. In fact, this approach should be preferred as
superior, since extinction coefficients are not truly constant, but vary as
function of stellar parameters. This is discussed at length in Paper I (see
Fig 18). For practical purposes however, it might be useful to have an
estimate of the extinction coefficient appropriate for each filter. With this
purpose in mind, in our papers we provide tables of extinction coefficients for
all our filters. For very cool stars (in particular for filters at short
wavelengths), extinction coefficients might depart significantly from our
tabulated values. Users can easily compute extinction coefficients from our
routines as described in Paper I, Appendix A.


	    	              DESCRIPTION OF FILES

-selectbc.data     input file where up to 5 filters can be selected by the user
		   to compute bolometric corrections. The user can also select
		   the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation underlying the synthetic
		   stellar fluxes from which bolometric corrections have been
		   computed.

-get4bctables.for  program to create tables of BC in the filters selected above,
		   at the reddening E(B-V) entered when running the program.
		   E(B-V) can range from 0 to 0.72.

-bcutil.for        program containing subroutines to interpolate the bolometric
		   correction tables created with get4bctables.for, at the
		   desired value of Teff, log(g) and [Fe/H], for the chosen
		   [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation (depending on the subroutine
		   called: getbc_std, getbc_m04, getbc_p00, and getbc_p04). By
		   default, bcutil.for produces a verbose output via:
		   write(6,1004) ebv,fe,(fil(k),k=1,ndx)
		   Verbose mode is commented out when running the shell scripts
		   provided with this package.

-bcstars.for       program to print out bolometric corrections. It must be
		   compiled and linked with bcutil.for (from which it calls one
		   of the following subroutines getbc_std, getbc_m04, getbc_p00,
		   and getbc_p04. The user must change the subroutine called,
		   depending on the [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation chosen in
		   selectbc.data).

-iso2cmd.for       to convert Victoria-Regina isochrones (VandenBerg et al.
		   2014) from the theoretical Teff-Luminosity plane into the
		   observational planes chosen in selectbc.data.
		   Victoria-Regina isochrones can be retrieved from 
		   http://apps.canfar.net/storage/list/VRmodels
		   One example of such isochrones is included here
		   (a0zz_p0y25p00.iso).

For practical purposes, most users will have a list of input values for which
they wish to know bolometric corrections in the systems entered in selectbc.data
To this purpose, we provide three shell scripts that automatise most of the
work. The shell scripts are listed below, and their use is described in
EXAMPLES.

-bcgo              to compute bolometric corrections from an input list of
		   log(g), [Fe/H] and Teff (an example of this list is given in
		   the file input.sample). User will be prompted to input the
		   desired value of reddening. 

-bcall             to compute bolometric corrections from an input list of
		   log(g), [Fe/H] Teff and E(B-V) (an example of this list is
		   given in the file input.sample.all).

-cmdgo             to convert isochrones in the observational plane.

				 EXAMPLES

A) Generate bolometric correction for stars of know logg, [Fe/H] and Teff at
   fixed E(B-V).

   1- add parameters for your stars (logg, [Fe/H] and Teff) in file input.sample
   2- select filters, and alpha enhancement models in selectbc.data
   3- compile and run get4bctables.for. A value of E(B-V) will be requested.
      Enter 0. for no reddening, or whichever value of reddening necessary (as
      long as E(B-V)<=0.72).
   4- compile, link (with bcutil.for) and run bstars.for (bcstars.for assumes
      that input stellar parameters are read from a file named input.sample.
      Also, by default bcstars.for calls the subroutine getbc_std. This is
      correct if 1  = ialf in selectbc.data. If other values of ialf are
      selected, then getbc_p04, getbc_p00 or getbc_m04 must be called instead).
   5- bolometric corrections in filters selected at 2- will appear on the
      screen. If less than 5 filters have been specified in selectbc.data,
      0.000 will be returned in the remaining columns. 
      The program will run in verbose mode, for each object in input.sample
      until the end, or it will STOP if one of the input stellar parameter is
      outside of the grid.

   Steps 3 to 5 can be done automatically running the script bcgo. This script
   comments out the verbose mode, hence it is more practical when dealing with a
   large input sample. (bcgo should be executable; if not, on the terminal
   window go to the directory where bcgo is located and type "chmod u+x bcgo"
   to make it executable once for all).
   Then, simply type "./bcgo" on terminal, input desired reddening value
   when prompted to do so, and hit return. A table for the bolometric
   corrections and [alpha/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation selected will be printed on
   the screen (or see option in bcgo to redirect the output into a file). 



B) Generate bolometric correction from an input list (named input.sample.all)
   having the following columns: star ID, logg, [Fe/H], Teff, E(B-V)<=0.72.

   This is a generalisation of the previous example.   
   1- Select filters and alpha enhancement models in selectbc.data
   2- Run the shell script bcall (type "./bcall" on terminal), and everything
      will be done automatically for you (the script bcall should be executable;
      if not, "chmod u+x bcall" to make it such).
      The script will read the file input.sample.all, and return an output file
      named output.file.all. This file contains the information in
      input.sample.all, plus the bolometric corrections for the filters and
      alpha-enhancement models selected in selectbc.data (if less than 5
      filters have been specified in selectbc.data, 0.000 will be returned in
      the remaining columns).
      Please NOTE that in output.file.all entries will be sorted in order of
      ascending E(B-V) (i.e. the order will not be necessarily the same as in
      input.sample.all, but this is not an issue since all information in
      input.sample.all is carried along in output.file.all).
      Also, if an entry is outside of the parameter space covered by the grid,
      the script will write "input stellar parameters outside of the grid" in
      output.file.all, and move to the next object.



C) Apply synthetic colours and bolometric corrections to the Victoria-Regina
   isochrones. Here, one example of such isochrones is included
   (a0zz_p0y25p00.iso). For more Victoria-Regina isochrones, please go to:
   http://apps.canfar.net/storage/list/VRmodels

   1- select filters in selectbc.data (alpha-enhancement is not relevant, as
      the program will interpolate to the same alpha-enhancement of the
      Victoria-Regina isochrones).
   2- compile and run get4bctables.for. A value of E(B-V) will be requested.
      Enter 0. for no reddening, or whichever value of reddening necessary (as
      long as E(B-V)<=0.72).
   3- compile, link (with bcutil.for) and run iso2cmd.for
   4- isochrones in the filters selected at 1- and reddening entered at 2- are
      written in a file with standard extension .cmd
      Please NOTE that the filters returned in the .cdm file are bolometric
      corrections (e.g. BC_i and BC_j), not magnitudes! Hence absolute
      magnitudes will be:
      M_i = M_bol - BC_i
      M_j = M_bol - BC_j
      and colours
      i-j = BC_j - BC_i

   Steps 2 and 3 can be done automatically with the script cmdgo (the script
   should be executable; if not, on the terminal window, go to the directory
   where cmdgo is located and type "chmod u+x cmdgo" to make it executable).
   Then, simply type "./cmdgo" on terminal, and enter reddening and isochrone
   name when prompted to do so.
